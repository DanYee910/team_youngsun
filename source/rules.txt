Rules of "Blackjack for Babies"
=============================

This game is a greatly simplified version
of Cal Blackjack(GEGA-001194).  Many rules
are omitted, such as insurance, double down,
surrender, split, bonus bets, etc...  It
simulates play using a static 6 deck "shoe",
no continuous shuffle.

Objective:
To obtain either a Blackjack or a hand with total
value closest to 21 without going over.  You are
playing against the "house" hand, for simplicity
the house will be referred to as the DEALER.

=============================
Rankings:
=============================
Any combination of cards >= 22 total = bust/lose
Any combination of cards <= 21 total = the total
Blackjack(Ace + 10 card) = 21.5

Blackjack is the highest hand, beating a 21 hand.

=============================
Card values:
=============================
Card suits do not matter, and are omitted.

2-9: The number on the card
10,J,Q,K: 10
Ace: 1 or 11

=============================
Playing a hand:
=============================
The first and third cards are dealt to the player.
The second and fourth cards are dealt to the DEALER.
The DEALER is showing only 1 card face-up initially.

1. Dealer may check hole card.
If the DEALER hand's upcard is a 10,J,Q,K, or Ace,
the dealer checks the hole card underneath.  If that
card makes a Blackjack, the Dealer reveals it, and play
ends with the DEALER having Blackjack.  If no Blackjack,
the card remains hidden and play continues as normal.

2. Player acts.
Players choose to HIT a card or STAY. Repeat the
process until the player either decides to STAY
or busts.  Blackjacks are an automatic stay.

3. Dealer Hand acts.
Reveal the hole card.  Plays house way.
If total >= 17, STAY.  If total < 17 then HIT.

4. Hands are compared, win/lose determined, and bets are
resolved.  A player bust counts as a loss, even if the
DEALER hand proceeds to bust after.
